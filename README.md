<br>Personalization:
<br>If you would like to change the hotkeys, simply right click on the file, select "edit script", and find and replace.
<br>For ctrl+ and alt+ functions, the find and replace is ^[key] and ![hotkey], respectively. To change alt+n, for example, find and replace would look for !n
